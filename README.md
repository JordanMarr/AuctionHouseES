# AuctionHouseES
A sample Auction House application in F# with event sourcing by Marten / PostgreSQL.

## Features
* ASPNET Minimal API (no template used)
* Giraffe
* [Marten](https://martendb.io/) (Event Sourcing) + PostgreSQL
* An Api.http test file (requires a REST Client extension for VS or VS Code)

## Why
I've been interested in event sourcing, but I have avoided it because I don't want to roll my own framework.
After watching [Jeremy Miller](https://twitter.com/jeremydmiller)'s [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWpuUHXLhYg) with [Derek Comartin](https://twitter.com/codeopinion), it looked pretty sweet and I wanted to kick the tires to see if it was as easy as Jeremy made it look (I think it was), and what would it look like using F#.

Overall, I'm impressed with Marten so far! Everything worked just as Jeremy explained in the video.

## Contribute
I would really love to see improvements made to this, alternative approaches, or even a side-by-side comparison made with another framework.
I would also be curious to see what suggestions the F# community has on improvements that could be made for F#.
