# AuctionHouseES
A sample Auction House application in F# with event sourcing by Marten / PostgreSQL.

## Features
* ASPNET Minimal API (no template used)
* Giraffe
* Marten (Event Sourcing) + PostgreSQL
* An Api.http test file (requires a REST Client extension for VS or VS Code)

## Why
I've been interested in event sourcing, but I have avoided it because I don't want to roll my own framework.
After watching [Jeremy Miller](https://twitter.com/jeremydmiller)'s presentation with [Derek Comartin](https://twitter.com/codeopinion), it looked pretty sweet and I wanted to kick the tires to see if it was as easy as Jeremy made it look (I think it was), and what would it look like using F#.
